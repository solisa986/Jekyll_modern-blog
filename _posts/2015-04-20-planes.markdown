### Adriana Solis

Scroll to see my educational, technical, and personal information ðŸ˜Š.

### Educational Background

I graduated from Spring Hill High School in May 2019. During my time at Spring Hill, I competed in a variety of competitions for Accounting, CX Debate, Marching Band, and Solo and Ensemble. I am currently attending Allegheny College with an expected 2023 year graduation. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Economics. During my time at Allegheny, I was able to form a variety of professional and technical skills in relation to the field of computer science. I had previously taken courses that added on to my interpersonal professional skills where I learned about the framework and introductory timelines, vernaculars, and format of software engineering. I have also worked on a department-wide project, GatorMiner.

### Technical Background

My technical background involves data analysis, debugging, GitHub flow framework, linting, and implementing complex programs using Python and Java. I intend to expand on these tools and languages in my future work. Given my course background, I am looking for positions that are in Software Engineering or Data Analysis.

### Personal Life

Outside of my life at college, I spend time with friends, drink way too much coffee, and get occasionally attacked by my cat, Frankie. I also currently intern remotely at First Bank of the Lake, a bank in Missouri. This type of work gives me an insight into the mechanisms behind loan processes, data processing, and professional behavior in the workplace. I am also involved in a variety of clubs on campus: International Club as their Secretary, Women in Business and Economics as their Social Chair, Allegheny ESports as their Personal Relations Chair, Allegheny Student Government as a Student Proxy, and Wind Symphony as a member.
