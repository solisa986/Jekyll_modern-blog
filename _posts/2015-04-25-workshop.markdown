### Clubs

During my time at Allegheny, I was able to join a variety of clubs that contributed to my varied interests. For most of these clubs, I was a long-standing member, but there are a certain few that I was given the opportunity to become more than a member. For these clubs, I was elected to the board, where I was able to provide a variety of different events, meetings, and activities to the community at Allegheny. For more information on my role in the club, please click on the club name for more information :smile:.
