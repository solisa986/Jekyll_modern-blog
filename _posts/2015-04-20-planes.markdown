### Educational Background

I graduated from Spring Hill High School in May 2019. During my time at Spring Hill, I competed in a variety of competitions for Accounting, CX Debate, Marching Band, and Solo and Ensemble. I am currently attending Allegheny College with an expected 2023 year graduation. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Economics. During my time at Allegheny, I was able to form a variety of professional and technical skills in relation to the field of computer science. I had previously taken courses that added on to my interpersonal professional skills where I learned about the framework and introductory timelines, vernaculars, and format of software engineering. I have also worked on a department-wide project, GatorMiner.

### Technical Background

My technical background involves data analysis, debugging, GitHub flow framework, linting, and implementing complex programs using Python and Java. 

### Personal Background

Outside of my life at college, I intern remotely at First Bank of the Lake, a bank in Missouri.
