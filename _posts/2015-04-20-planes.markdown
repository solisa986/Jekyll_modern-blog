### **Personal Biography**

My background consists of accounting principles, data analysis, software engineering, and complex programming with Python and Java. A personal goal that I would like to achieve in my future professional endeavors is to be able to perfect my knowledge and experience with Python, Java, and other programming languages. I am hoping to showcase my skills with Python through my future technical roles. I am currently attending Allegheny College for my undergraduate studies, with an expected 2023 year graduation. During my time at Allegheny, I was able to form a variety of professional and technical skills in relation to the field of computer science. I had previously taken courses that added on to my interpersonal professional skills where I learned about the framework and introductory timelines, vernaculars, and format of software engineering. I have also worked on a departmen-wide project, GatorMiner. My work on GatorMiner spanned a semester and was conducted with an agile-scrum framework. I currently work at an internship at First Bank of the Lake, where I am trained on case-specific loan applications. I am aiming to continuously update my technical knowledge on Python and Java in a professional workplace. When I am not working, coding, or studying, I like to spend time with my friends and family.
