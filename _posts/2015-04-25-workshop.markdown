### Summary

This page serves to show the variety of different clubs, job experiences, professional experiences, awards, scholarships, and other extracurriculars that I participated in from May 2019 to present.

### Clubs

During my time at Allegheny, I was able to join a variety of clubs that contributed to my varied interests.

For these clubs, I was elected to the board, where I was able to provide a variety of different events, meetings, and activities to the community at Allegheny.
