### Summary

This page is dedicated to showcasing the different technical concepts that I have explored during my time at Allegheny College.

### Course and Technical Experiences for Completed Courses

***Computational Expression - Spring 2020***
- **Technical Skills learned:**
  - design, implement, and test algorithms in Java, an object-oriented programming language
  - how to generate an SSH key
  - how to write in a markdown file
  - how to set up and use Git Hub, GitHub actions, Gradle, and Travis CI
  - fundamental concept of data types, conditional logic, iteration, recursion, exceptions, and graphics programming
  - how to use single-dimension, multi-dimensional, and extendable arrays to implement graphical applications
  - design, implementation, use, and testing of software such as Docker, Atom Text Editor, and GatorGrader
  - basic Linux and Windows terminal commands
  - computational structures needed to solve problems, produce interactive games, computer-mediated art and music
  - how to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers
  - complete weekly technical projects that demonstrate the material taught in class that week
- **Professional Skills learned:**
  - introduction to computer science and computational thinking
  - wrote weekly progress reports that thoroughly explained the mechanisms included in my technical writing
  - how to work on projects using the team feature in GitHub
  - provided oral presentations on the analysis of code and other technical concepts explored in class

***Data Abstraction - Fall 2020***
- **Technical Skills Learned:**
  - how to use Git Hub, Gradle, Travic CI, and GradleGrader for team-based assignments
  - how to write more sophisticatedly in markdown
  - how to efficiently store and retrieve digital data through the implementation, use, and evaluation of computational structures
  - how to create data structures and algorithms through the use of the Java programming language
  - how to test the accuracy of a program through test cases
  - how to use the fundamentals of nodes to create mapping functions for complex programs
  - how to create a results table that displays the timing results for a program
  - how to implement sorting algorithms, such as BubbleSort and InsertionSort
  - how to use the concepts of a linked list to create Singly Linked Lists and Doubly Linked Lists
  - how to use the concepts explored in class to create my own program, which is an encrypted collection of ciphers that masks user's input
- **Professional Skills Learned:**
  - how to utilize Git Hub Team to work on certain assignments without any merge conflicts
  - how to communicate with other members of the class during our class-wide collaboration on certain assignments
  - how to properly dictate the analysis of the code, test suites, and results from running the program into a markdown file
  - how to set up and abide by technical deadlines during the implementation of my group project
